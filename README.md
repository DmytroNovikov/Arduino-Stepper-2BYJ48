Arduino-Stepper-2BYJ48
======================

Library for bidirectional operation of a 2BYJ48 stepper motor with a 5-way connector, using a ULN2003 interface board to drive the stepper.


I like mechanical watches. I like listening to their heartbeats in an empty room. You'll never feel alone with your little ticking .
But it is some kind of problem if you have got more than one self-winding mechanical watch. You have to wind them every day. I knew about watch winders, but I want to create that one by myself!
